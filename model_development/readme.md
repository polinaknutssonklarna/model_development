# Model development
 
This repository describes model development:
- `1_explore_data.ipynb` explores data to define the target variable and generate feature engineering ideas 
- `2_select_modeling_technique.ipynb` compares Logistic Regression, Random Forest and Gradient Boosted Trees models to select one for further development
- `3*_.ipynb` these notebooks test various specifications to select the best one
- `4_final_model.ipynb` tunes and evaluates the final model on test data
